Graph traverse using DFS:

	0. check if current point is NOT even in the graph

	1. check if the next point has been VISITED

	2. check if next point is destination or in the base case of recursive rule, do this job

	3. the order of 1. 2. matters, e.g. if start is the same with end, then change the order of 	1. 2. will miss this
