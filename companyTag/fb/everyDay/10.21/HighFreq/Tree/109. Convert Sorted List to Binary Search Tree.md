109. Convert Sorted List to Binary Search Tree.md



	Sorted -> Inorder traversal to construct

	but when inorder, when to stop?

	we need to know how deep I should go

	so first count for the list -> n


	construct n/2 nodes for the left

	construct 1 node for root

	construct n - n/2 - 1 for right



	base case is n == 0 return null


Mistakes :

	ListNode, TreeNode, different type!!!

		Declear, 

		Pass into function, 

		Return type, 

		Assignment, 

		Operation like . or call its method

	check for those one by one;
